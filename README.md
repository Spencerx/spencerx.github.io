Research Code
=========

This page is just a bit of data for you to get the gist of the data on my GitHub page if code has any value to you, you build it, study, modify to customise your applications. That process is a subject of various formal methods, treatise, endless forum posts which are beyond the scope of my current focus as exibited by my starring, watching, reading or tweeting about software...

'Ad' infinitum

Hints from GitHub itself of creating citable code, it helps https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/


For the hyperactive coder or the average person who needs to do more with their time if they ever research there's code as a research object  http://mozillascience.org/code-as-a-research-object-a-new-project/
##### This Github landing page was created using Dillinger a markdown editor:

Dillinger is a cloud-enabled HTML5 Markdown editor.
Markdown is a lightweight markup language based on the formatting conventions that people naturally use in email.  As [John Gruber] writes on the [Markdown site] [1]:

This text you see here is *actually* written in Markdown! To get a feel for Markdown's syntax, type some text into the left window and watch the results in the right.
